# üéµ Review Rating Prediction for Musical Instruments

This is an NLP-based machine learning project designed to predict product ratings based on customer reviews and summaries from the Amazon Musical Instruments dataset. This project focuses on **text preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **classification modeling** using both Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF vectorizations.

## üéØ Use Case

This project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing can help e-commerce platforms:
- Predict user ratings from written reviews.
- Improve **personalized product recommendations**.
- Identify inconsistencies between written sentiment and numerical rating.
- Build smart review summarization systems.

---

## üì¶ Dataset

- **File**: `Musical_instruments_reviews.csv` and `Musical_Instruments_5.json`
- **Independent Features**: `reviewText + summary` (combined as a single input text)
- **Dependent Feature**: `overall` (rating from 1 to 5)

---

## üßπ Text Cleaning & Preprocessing

The following steps were applied to prepare the review text:

- Removing stopwords
- Removing punctuation
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization
- Feature Extraction:
  - Bag-of-Words (BoW)
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

## üß† Neural Network Notes

- **Neuron Type**: Sigmoid neuron
- **Activation Function**: Sigmoid
  - Reason: Output maps between 0 and 1, ideal for binary/multiclass classification.
- **Optimizer**: (Not explicitly mentioned, but likely SGD or Adam)
  - Role: Adjusts weights to optimize model accuracy.
